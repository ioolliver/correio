You don't got a cupid? Let Correio play cupid for you.

This is a project for my second year of technical graduation in software development at ETEC de SÃ£o Paulo. On this second year, I learned about C#, ASP.NET and SQL Server and this project is a compilation of everything I absorbed + my previous knowledge. This was a collaboractive project made with my classmate and friend [Arthur Bayer](https://github.com/BayerTu).
